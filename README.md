# spotify-clone
- It is a complete spotify clone using reactjs for front end and express for the server part

- So basically in this project I have used spotify api to fetch user's data and then I have interpreted it according to my taste and styled it in different way. Ofcourse it is not   the complete spotfy clone but you can check your all playlists your songs in playlist you can search for songs you can find your top artists and their top tracks, new releases,   your top tracks and many more

- Before starting with the project ensure that you have a good knowledge of hooks and axios

- The packages which you need to install for the proper functioning of code are:
  1. Install nodejs before starting anything
  2. npm i express
  3. npm i bootstrap
